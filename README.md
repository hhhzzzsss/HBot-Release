# HBot-Release
Source code release for HBot. To be used as a reference.

While this repository contains a large majority of HBot's source code, certain features and classes were removed at my discretion, including HBot.java, which is needed for the bot to work. This is to discourage people from making exact copies of HBot.

**This is not meant to be a fully-functioning version. It will not compile.**

I'm happy to let people use my code as a reference, but I would prefer for bots to be new and interesting, and not copies of existing bots and/or their features.

Anyway, most of the structure of my project is left intact, so feel free to look around and see how it works.
