# HBot-Release
Source code release for HBot. To be used as a reference.

While this repository contains the large majority of HBot's source code, certain features and classes were removed at my own discretion, including HBot.java, which is needed for the bot to work, to prevent people from making copies of HBot.

**This is not meant to be a fully-functioning version. It will not compile.**

I'm happy to let people use my code as a reference, but I'd apreciate it if people don't go around making exact copies of HBot and it's features.
It's always fun to see new, interesting bots on the server, but not so much to see people copy pasting others' bots all over the place and relabeling it as their own.

Anyway, most of the structure of my project is left intact, so feel free to look around and see how it works.
